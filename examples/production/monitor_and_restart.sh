# FastJob Production Monitoring and Auto-Recovery Script
# 
# This script monitors FastJob workers and automatically handles common issues:
# - Detects stale/dead workers
# - Restarts services when needed
# - Scales workers based on demand
# - Sends alerts for critical issues
#
# Usage: ./monitor_and_restart.sh
# Recommended: Run from cron every 5 minutes
